Github io url:

In this repository you will be able to use the hourly workday calendar to create and save content. The current date and time are conveniently at the top of the page. 

The rows are hourly from 9am - 5pm. When time passes the past hour blocks will turn grey, the present hour block will be red and any future 
blocks will be green. 

Your tasks will save to local storage whenever you hit the save button.
